#
# \brief Function type for callback used by CUPTI to request an empty
# buffer for storing activity records.
#
# This callback function signals the CUPTI client that an activity
# buffer is needed by CUPTI. The activity buffer is used by CUPTI to
# store activity records. The callback function can decline the
# request by setting \p *buffer to NULL. In this case CUPTI may drop
# activity records.
#
# \param buffer Returns the new buffer. If set to NULL then no buffer
# is returned.
# \param size Returns the size of the returned buffer.
# \param maxNumRecords Returns the maximum number of records that
# should be placed in the buffer. If 0 then the buffer is filled with
# as many records as possible. If > 0 the buffer is filled with at
# most that many records before it is returned.

#
#  \brief Function type for callback used by CUPTI to return a buffer
#  of activity records.
# 
#  This callback function returns to the CUPTI client a buffer
#  containing activity records.  The buffer contains \p validSize
#  bytes of activity records which should be read using
#  cuptiActivityGetNextRecord. The number of dropped records can be
#  read using cuptiActivityGetNumDroppedRecords. After this call CUPTI
#  relinquished ownership of the buffer and will not use it
#  anymore. The client may return the buffer to CUPTI using the
#  CUpti_BuffersCallbackRequestFunc callback.
#  Note: CUDA 6.0 onwards, all buffers returned by this callback are
#  global buffers i.e. there is no context/stream specific buffer.
#  User needs to parse the global buffer to extract the context/stream
#  specific activity records.
# 
#  \param context The context this buffer is associated with. If NULL, the
#  buffer is associated with the global activities. This field is deprecated
#  as of CUDA 6.0 and will always be NULL.
#  \param streamId The stream id this buffer is associated with.
#  This field is deprecated as of CUDA 6.0 and will always be NULL.
#  \param buffer The activity record buffer.
#  \param size The total size of the buffer in bytes as set in
#  CUpti_BuffersCallbackRequestFunc.
#  \param validSize The number of valid bytes in the buffer.
